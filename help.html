 <h4>How do I start the camera?</h4>

 <p>To view the webcam, simply return to the "Live Video" tab and click the play button in the centre of the image. After a few seconds buffering you should see the live video feed, the delay is typically ~40 seconds, so you are seeing everything (almost) as it happens.</p>

 <h4>Are there any recordings?</h4>
 <p>Yes, if you use the "Video Clips" and "Still Images" tabs, you can view recorded clips and pictures from the last few days. The times these clips are taken at are based on the standard timetable, so hopefully some will show the train going in or out of the station.</p>

 <h4>I can see a speaker symbol on the webcam interface and have the volume turned up, but there is no sound.</h4>
 <p>Sorry, the camera doesn't have sound. Your browser provides the speaker option regardless, we can't turn it off.</p>

 <h4>Is this compatible with my web browser/device?</h4>
 <p>This webcam will work with most modern web browsers on most computers and mobile devices. However, there are a few exceptions, Windows XP is unsupported (sorry, it's just too old) and Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 is known to fail. (IE 11 on Windows 8/10 is OK).</p>

 <h4>The picture quality is low, although the video seems to be playing OK</h4>
 <p>Our camera provides two qualities, an HD feed for people with a fast internet connection and a lower quality feed if your connection is slower or congested by other users. The switching is automatic based on the detected speed of your connection. If the camera is particularly busy (say during a gala weekend), the feed quality may also drop because of the load on our server. If the feed quality is low, try reloading the page.</p>

 <h4>The video feed stopped with an error saying the data is corrupt.</h4>
 <p>Unfortuantly our camera does occasionally generate "bad data", to fix this just reload the webcam page and click play again.</p>

 <h4>The picture is corrupted or won't play (constant buffering).</h4>
 <p>As above, please try reloading. If the problem persists, we may be having trouble with the camera. If it's not fixed within 24 hours, please contact us and let us know, we might not have noticed. The webcam shares an internaet connection with other users at the station (staff and guests), if the station internet connection is really busy, the video feed might be interrupted from time to time.</p>

 <h4>Why does the camera not broadcast 24 hours?</h4>
 <p>Nothing much happens at the station overnight, so we figured there was no point in having the camera on. Webcam opening hours may be extended during special events such as Gala weekends.</p>

 <h4>The camera has gone off during opening hours.</h4>
 <p>We might be having a problem with our internet connection, please bear with us! If the problem persists, please get in touch and let us know.</p>

 <h4>The camera is in "maintenance mode".</h4>
 <p>We're working on fixing a problem or making an improvement. Please come back later and try again!</p>
